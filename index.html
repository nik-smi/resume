                <h2 class="text-xl">Product Manager</h2>
                <p>
                ðŸ‘” Profound business experience </br>
                Studied International Business with several internships in different departments across multiple industries. Founded and led a digital platform company for 5 years, where I recruited and led a team of 6. Managed different partner-facing projects, as well as business operations of a startup, incl. managing the companyâ€˜s finances, tax advisors, lawyers, and relationships with government institutions. 
                </br>
                ðŸŽ¨ Great skills in UX/UI design </br>
                Started back in 2012 by self-studying visual design, information architecture, and graphic design. My portfolio currently contains over 20 digital products (digital platforms and marketplaces, apps, websites, online shops), and over 470 digital and printed banners, flyers, resumes, whitepapers, and other advertising and promotional material. Successfully finished Googleâ€™s 5-month rigorous course for UX professionals, covering everything from UX theory, research, and wireframing all to low and high-fidelity prototyping and design delivery.
                </br>
                ðŸ’» And very good technical understanding</br>
                Worked very closely with developers both in internal and external setups on various projects, from the conceptualization phase until the delivery and throughout the scaling phase. Worked together with developers on an internal PIM solution, a system containing over 90 websites and online shops as well as over 10 digital platforms and marketplaces.
                </br>
                ðŸŽ¯ My goal is delivering digital products that feel great for the user and bring them value, give businesses a great competitive advantage over their competitors, and are not making developersâ€™ lives a living hell - yes, that definitely can be done!</p>
